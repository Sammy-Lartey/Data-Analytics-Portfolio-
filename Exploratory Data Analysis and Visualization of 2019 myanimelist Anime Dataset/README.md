Conducted an exploratory data analysis on anime statistics. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aludosan/myanimelist-anime-dataset-as-20190204) and contains 15,278 rows and 27 columns.

My aim is to extract insights from the dataset to understand which genres and anime rankings are particularly popular and i intend to provide recommendations to the community based on this analysis.
